**Django and HTMX Integration from a Widget Perspective.**

---

## 📦 What is this?

**Djinx** is a Django package that provides seamless integration between Django form widgets and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/). It aims to reduce boilerplate and promote clean, component-like behavior in your views and templates.

Use it to:
- Add HTMX behavior to Django forms declaratively.
- Simplify progressive enhancement in your app.
- Avoid repetitive HTML/JS when building dynamic, interactive UIs.
